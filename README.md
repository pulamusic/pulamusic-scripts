# pulamusic-scripts

This is a repo of utility scripts I often reuse, using them with [jsDelivr open-source CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github).

I'm using [codebeautify.org to validate the js](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate).

## active-scripts

#### copyright.js

A simple script that updates the copyright year.

```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pulamusic/pulamusic-scripts@master/copyright.js"></script>
```

#### time-zone-offset.js

A simple script that calculates time-zone offsets. This is an important one given that I work remotely, and I am updating my professional website to include i18n pages in French and Spanish.

## draft-scripts

a bunch of these scripts were adapted [from acme.com](https://acme.com/javascript/). Some of the scripts seem to have been updated in 2019, but many of them are from c.2005. *Everything from this source needs to be re-written according to **>=ES6** syntax*.

#### editinplace.js

**Do this one first**. This script, borrowed from acme.com, allows a viewer to edit text on the webpage. Needs work.

#### calendar.js

Adds a simple calendar widget to a webpage. Adapted from acme.com

#### keynav.js

Another script from acme.com that could be very useful. This one just creates event handlers for the keyboard. This could be very helpful when creating interactive sounds for my site.

#### colorpicker.js

An acme.com color picker widget.

#### irritating-switch-statement.js

I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but here it is anyway.

#### dateFormat.js

A date formatting script I wrote for a Vue app. Needs work.

#### word-cloud

This is an unfinished project, but it could be reusable.

#### clusterer.js

This needs to be entirely re-written in modern js, but it could be very cool.

#### tabbed-panes.js

Needs updating. Borrowed from acme.com.

#### suggestions.js

Another script borrowed from acme.com. This script adds pop-up suggestions to a page.

#### menu-widget.js

An acme.com script. JS needs updating.

#### message-overlay.js

Needs updating.
